<h1>Workout Tips & Advice</h1>
<h2>1. What is the best routine for the gym?</h2>
<p>
The best routine for the gym is one that is flexible with your schedule and you actually enjoy. These two factors will contribute greatly to your ability to be consistent with your workouts. Consistency with your workouts and progressing as you perform them is what will lead to results.

That being said, there are plenty of great workout program styles one can do to build muscle, lose fat, or build strength. The body composition goals (building muscle and losing fat) will be accomplished through similar style workouts combined with differing nutritional principles, while those looking for strength gains may need to focus on programs that are centered on the idea of specificity.

To sum that statement up, if you want to change your body composition, you will want to train with volume. If you want to build strength, you will want a program that is strength specific for the lifts you want to improve such as the bench press, squat and deadlift.</p>

<h2>2. What body parts to work on what days?</h2>
<p>The answer to this question would assume that the person asking is referring to body part splits. In this case, the way you split your days likely won’t matter too much, as long as you work every body part throughout the week.

There may be some benefit into ensuring you don’t hit chest and shoulders or legs and back on consecutive days, but if you do, it probably won’t be that big of an issue depending on your overall strength levels.

However, if you are looking to optimize your training by incorporating a higher training frequency (hitting each muscle group more often throughout the week), you may want to look into pairing certain muscle groups on certain workout days.

The most popular pairings are full body workouts, upper/lower workouts, push/pull workouts and push/pull/legs workouts.

Again, the actual days you put your workouts on likely won’t make that much of a difference to the overall outcome of your training so long as you are consistent with your workouts and implement progressive overload (increasing the weight used) over time.</p>

<h2>3. What should a beginner do at the gym?</h2>
<p>3. What should a beginner do at the gym?
The best thing a beginner can do at the gym is seek out the help of a trained professional to assist them with learning the proper form of each exercise. Practicing the basics and establishing a solid foundation in terms of form will help a beginner lifter remain injury free throughout their life.

If you are not in the position to hire a trained professional, you may want to proceed working out with some level of caution. The same recommendation of practicing the fundamentals still applies. Start off with light weight (the bar on barbell exercises) and record yourself performing exercises.

With the exercise recordings, compare your form with examples of proper form. Evaluate how you are moving and progress from there by either working on your form, or after you’ve mastered your form, adding weight.
